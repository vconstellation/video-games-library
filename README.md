# Video Games Library - catalogue app

Simple app used to catalogue the user's video game library, with options to mark which titles are being currently played, and which have been already completed. 
In addition to being a simple library, the app allows users to rate and review video games, as well as to customize their profile pages with a short description, avatar and a background image.

Users can use this app to display their video games' collection, keep track of the titles that they've completed and the ones that they intend to complete, and to grade video games using four different scales (music, gameplay, story and visuals).
The average of scores will then be calculated and displayed on the video game's page. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:

* Django 3.1.5
* django-crispy-forms 1.10.0
* Pillow 8.1.0
* Psycopg2 2.8.6 and PostgreSQL 13.0

* Bootstrap 5

## Launch

Forementioned Python modules are required to properly run the app. 
Setting up the video game's database from scratch is mandatory (i.e. manually adding records for video game's developers, titles, etc.).

## Project status

All of the app's backend is completed and functional. 
Frontend of the app is semi-completed, as it's operational, but not up to the intended quality.
